# DP Port Checker v0

## Project Development

Exciting News! I've been actively working on tools like DP Port Checker for the past few months, and I'm thrilled to share them with you. However, I want to be transparent about a few things:

- Learning Journey: I am still on a learning journey, and these tools are a reflection of my growth as a developer. Expect to see improvements over time!
- Bug Reports: These tools might have bugs or issues. Your bug reports and feedback are incredibly valuable in helping me enhance the functionality and reliability of the tools.
- No Classes: At the moment, I'm using a more script-like or procedural approach instead of classes. As I continue to learn, I might refactor and improve the code structure.

## Requirements

Before running DP Port Checker, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3: Download and install Python 3 from python.org.
- Python Libraries: PyQt6, Scapy
  You can install the required Python libraries using the following command:
  pip install PyQt6 scapy
